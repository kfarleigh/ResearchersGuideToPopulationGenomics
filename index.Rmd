# Preface {-}
## About the Author {-}
Hi! I am an bioinformatician, data scientist, and  NSF postdoctoral research fellow in biology Ph.D. candidate, bioinformatician, data scientist, working in the [Schield lab](https://schieldlab.org/) at the University of Virginia. I use bioinformatic techniques to understand how genomic and phenotypic variation is influenced by environmental factors. I am particularly interested in local adaptation, hybridization, and the development of new bioinformatic tools for biological applications. Feel free to visit my [website](https://kfarleigh.github.io/) or [CV](https://kfarleigh.github.io/CV/KFarleigh_CV_8-12-2025.pdf) if you'd like to check out my past work. 

## Motivation  {-}
This book was created to help anyone interested in analyzing population genomic data. I have spent many hours in my Ph.D. and post-doc trying to develop and understand scripts to analyze data. I hope that this book makes someone's life easier and provides a clear and concise explanation of commonly used population genomic analyses. It is a work in progress, so feel free to [reach out](https://kfarleigh.github.io/contact/) with any comments, suggestions, or if you would like to contribute a chapter.


## Acknowledgements {-}
I thank my wife, advisors, and collaborators for their support and help with many of the topics discussed in this book. I also acknowledge and thank the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRF Award #2037786), NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology (NSF DBI-2409958) and Miami University for funding my dissertation, post-doctoral fellowship, and for providing the opportunity to develop this book. I also thank the University of Virginia for hosting me during my post-doc.
