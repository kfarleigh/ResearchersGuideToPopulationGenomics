# Preface {-}
## About the Author {-}
Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate, bioinformatician, data scientist, and National Science Foundation Doctoral Fellow working in the [Jezkova lab](https://caloprymnus.com/) at Miami University (OH). I use bioinformatic techniques to understand how genomic variation is influenced by environmental factors. I am particularly interested in the genomics of local adaptation, hybridization, and the development of new bioinformatic tools for biological applications. Feel free to visit my [website](https://kfarleigh.github.io/) or [CV](https://kfarleigh.github.io/CV/KFarleigh_CV_9-1-2023.pdf) if you'd like to check out my past work. 

## Motivation  {-}
This book was created to help anyone interested in analyzing population genomic data. I have spent many hours in my Ph.D. trying to develop and understand scripts to analyze population genomic data. I hope that this book makes someone's life easier and provides a clear and concise explanation of commonly used population genomic analyses. It is a work in progress, so feel free to [reach out](https://kfarleigh.github.io/contact/) with any comments or suggestions.


## Acknowledgements {-}
I thank my wife, advisor, and collaborators for their support and help with many of the topics discussed in this book. I also acknowledge and thank the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRF Award #2037786) and Miami University for funding my dissertation and for providing the opportunity to develop this book.
